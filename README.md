                          Distributed Computing of Matrix Operations

This project intents to solve relatively large computational problems by taking advantage of
spare processing power of many sparsely used computes. By doing so we want the effectively
emulate a high-end computer.

At the server system the user perceives the collection of autonomous processors as a unit
and becomes equipped to solving a large computational problem. When the server side receives
a computational problem, firstly it breaks the problem into subparts and sends the smaller
problems to several clients. All the client sides computes their subproblems and sends the
result to the central server, upon receiving all the answers to subproblems the server combines
the solutions to form the final solution which will be presented to the main user.

Applications of this can be numerous as many scientific and engineering fields uses
linear algebra extensively and most operations on matrixes and vectors can be divided smaller tasks,
each of which can solved by one or more computers.
